# Empatica_Data

## This is a Guide to Working with Empatica (E4) data for longitudinal studies.

Data from Empatica is downloaded as zipped files with individual .csv files for each sensor during that recording period. The recording periods can vary in length from seconds to days. These instructions are such that you can keep the data as individual sensor types (important if you are doing a study and using only 1-2 sensors).
